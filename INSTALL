STANDARD INSTALLATION

To install the package, assure to have write permissions for you Perl 
Library directories. Then do the three steps:

   1. perl Makefile.PL

   2. make test

   3. make install

"perl Makefile.PL" creates a Makefile for your system. "make test" tries
out, if the module really works at your system, and "make install" installs
the Unicode::Map hierarchy. This installs also the two utilities:

   map       - maps characters from and to unicode encoding
   mkmapfile - creates binary mapfiles from textual mapfiles


INDIVIDUAL INSTALLATION

It can happen, that you need to assure where to install executables, library 
files and manpages. To do so, do the three steps from above with one 
modification: in the first step the creation of the Makefile shall happen
with an additional PREFIX option.

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/usr/local/

If you are using WINDOWS platforms, the module ExtUtils::MakeMaker probably
will still not be ported and thus be missing in your perl distribution. This 
is quite bad, as it hinders you from testing and installing the module 
automatically. It might be, that the module works anyway, but you will have
to copy all files to appropriate places by hand...


ON ERROR

If the "make test" should produce errors, please comment them to me.
