To install the package, assure to have write permissions for you Perl 
Library directories. Then do the lines:

   perl Makefile.PL

   make install

This will install the Unicode::Map hierarchy to your system and also
the utilities:

   map       - maps characters from and to unicode encoding
   mkmapfile - creates binary mapfiles from textual mapfiles

If you need assure where to install executables, library files and manpages, 
install the distribution with the PREFIX option, like:

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/usr/local/

   make install

If you are using WINDOWS platforms, the module ExtUtils::MakeMaker probably
will be missing in your perl distribution. This is quite bad, as it hinders
you from installing the module automatically. You will have to copy all files
to appropriate places by hand.
